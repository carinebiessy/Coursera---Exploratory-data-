# Coursera---Exploratory-data-

I unzipped the "household_power_consumption.txt" file and put it in my R working directory so if you want to run/test my program you should have the "txt" data file in your working directory.

I just change my R code because first I let all the code I typed to get the graph in order to show all my steps but by grading other students I realized that it could be misleading for my own grading, so I retrieved part of my extra code.
